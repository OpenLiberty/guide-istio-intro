== What you'll learn

You will learn how to deploy an application to a Kubernetes cluster and enable {istio} on it. You will also learn how to configure
{istio} to shift traffic to implement blue-green deployments for microservices.

=== What is {istio}?

https://istio.io/[{istio}^] is a service mesh, meaning that it's a platform for managing
how microservices interact with each other and the outside world.
{istio} consists of a control plane and sidecars that are injected into application pods. The sidecars contain
the https://www.envoyproxy.io/[Envoy^] proxy. You can think of Envoy as a sidecar that intercepts
and controls all the HTTP and TCP traffic to and from your container.

While {istio} runs on top of {kube} and that will be the focus of this guide, you can also use {istio} with
other environments such as https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/[Docker Compose^]. {istio} has many features such as
traffic shifting, request routing, access control, and distributed tracing, but the focus of this guide will be on traffic shifting.

=== Why {istio}?

{istio} provides a collection of features that allows you to manage several aspects of your services.
One example is {istio}'s routing features. You can route HTTP requests based on several factors such as HTTP headers or cookies.
Another use case for {istio} is telemetry, which you can use to enable distributed tracing. Distributed tracing allows you
to visualize how HTTP requests travel between different services in your cluster by using a tool such as https://www.jaegertracing.io/[Jaeger^].
Additionally, as part of its collection of security features, {istio} allows you to enable mutual TLS between pods in your cluster.
Enabling TLS between pods secures communication between microservices internally.

https://openliberty.io/guides/istio-intro.html#what-are-blue-green-deployments[Blue-green deployments] are a method of deploying your applications such that you have two nearly identical environments where one acts
as a sort of staging environment and the other is a production environment. This allows you to switch traffic from staging to production
once a new version of your application has been verified to work.
You'll use {istio} to implement blue-green deployments. The traffic shifting feature allows you to allocate a percentage of
traffic to certain versions of services. You can use this feature to shift 100 percent of live traffic to blue deployments and 100 percent
of test traffic to green deployments. Then, you can shift the traffic to point to the opposite deployments as necessary to
perform blue-green deployments.

The microservice you'll deploy is called `system`.
It responds with your current system's JVM properties and it returns the app version in the response header.
You will increment the version number when you update the application.
With this number, you can determine which version of the microservice is running in your production or test environments.

=== What are blue-green deployments?

Blue-green deployments are a way of deploying your applications such that you have two environments where your application runs.
In this scenario, you will have a production environment and a test environment.
At any point in time, the blue deployment can accept production traffic and the green deployment can accept test traffic, or vice versa.
When you want to deploy a new version of your application, you deploy to the color that is acting as your test environment.
After the new version is verified on the test environment, the traffic is shifted over.
Thus, your live traffic is now being handled by what used to be the test site.

== Deploying version 1 of the system microservice

Navigate to the `guide-{projectid}/start` directory and run the following command to build the application locally.
[role=command]
```
mvn clean package
```



Next, run the `docker build` commands to build the container image for your application:
[role='command']
```
docker build -t system:1.0-SNAPSHOT .
```

The command builds a {docker} image for the `system` microservice.
The `-t` flag in the `docker build` command allows the Docker image to be labeled (tagged) in the `name[:tag]` format.
The tag for an image describes the specific image version.
If the optional `[:tag]` tag is not specified, the `latest` tag is created by default.
You can verify that this image was created by running the following command: 

[role=command]
```
docker images
```

You'll see an image called `system:1.0-SNAPSHOT` listed in a table similar to the output.

To deploy the `system` microservice to the {kube} cluster, use the following command to deploy the microservice.

[role=command]
```
kubectl apply -f system.yaml
```

You can see that your resources are created:

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
gateway.networking.istio.io/sys-app-gateway created
service/system-service created
deployment.apps/system-deployment-blue created
deployment.apps/system-deployment-green created

----
include::finish/system.yaml[tags=**;]
----

View the [hotspot file=0]`system.yaml` file. It contains two [hotspot=30-72 file=0]`deployments`, a [hotspot=17-28 file=0]`service`, a [hotspot=1-15 file=0]`gateway`, and a [hotspot=74-87 file=0]`destination rule`. One of the deployments is labeled [hotspot=33 hotspot=39 hotspot=44 file=0]`blue` and the second deployment is labeled [hotspot=55 hotspot=61 hotspot=66 file=0]`green`. The service points to both of these deployments. The {istio} gateway is the entry point for HTTP requests to the cluster. A destination rule is used to apply policies post-routing, in this situation it is used to define service subsets that can be specifically routed to.

traffic.yaml
[source, yaml, linenums, role='code_column no_copy']
----
include::start/traffic.yaml[tags=**;]
----

View the [hotspot file=1]`traffic.yaml` file. It contains two virtual services. A virtual service defines how requests are routed to your applications. In the virtual services, you can configure the weight, which controls the amount of traffic going to each deployment. In this case, the weights should be 100 or 0, which corresponds to which deployment is live.

Deploy the resources defined in the `traffic.yaml` file.

[role=command]
```
kubectl apply -f traffic.yaml
```

You can see that the virtual services have been created.

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
virtualservice.networking.istio.io/system-virtual-service created
virtualservice.networking.istio.io/system-test-virtual-service created
----

You can check that all of the deployments are available by running the following command.

[role=command]
```
kubectl get deployments
```

The command produces a list of deployments for your microservices that is similar to the following output.

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
NAME                     DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
system-deployment-blue    1         1         1            1           1m
system-deployment-green   1         1         1            1           1m
----

After all the deployments are available, you will make a request to version 1 of the deployed application. As defined in the [hotspot file=0]`system.yaml`, file the [hotspot=1-15 file=0]`gateway` is expecting the host to be `example.com`. However, requests to `example.com` won't be routed to the appropriate IP address. To ensure that the gateway routes your requests appropriately, ensure that the Host header is set to `example.com`. For instance, you can set the `Host` header with the `-H` option of the `curl` command.


Make a request to the service by running the following `curl` command.

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]

[.tab_content.windows_section]
--
[role=command]
```
curl -H "Host:example.com" -I http://localhost/system/properties
```
If the `curl` command is unavailable, then use https://www.getpostman.com/[Postman^]. Postman enables you
to make requests using a graphical interface. To make a request with Postman, enter `\http://localhost/system/properties`
into the URL bar. Next, switch to the `Headers` tab and add a header with key of `Host` and value of `example.com`.
Finally, click the blue `Send` button to make the request.
--

[.tab_content.mac_section]
--
[role=command]
```
curl -H "Host:example.com" -I http://localhost/system/properties
```
If the `curl` command is unavailable, then use https://www.getpostman.com/[Postman^]. Postman enables you
to make requests using a graphical interface. To make a request with Postman, enter `\http://localhost/system/properties`
into the URL bar. Next, switch to the `Headers` tab and add a header with key of `Host` and value of `example.com`.
Finally, click the blue `Send` button to make the request.

[.tab_content.linux_section]
--
[role=command]
```
export INGRESS_PORT=$(kubectl -n istio-system get service istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[?(@.name=="http2")].nodePort}')
curl -H "Host:example.com" -I http://`minikube ip`:$INGRESS_PORT/system/properties
```
--


You'll see a header called `x-app-version` along with the corresponding version.

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
x-app-version: 1.0-SNAPSHOT

SystemResource.java
[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/system/SystemResource.java[]
----

The `system` microservice is set up to respond with the version that is set in the `SystemResource.java` file.
The tag for the {docker} image is also dependent on the version that is specified in the `SystemResource.java` file.
Manually update the [hotspot=version]`APP_VERSION` field of the microservice to `2.0-SNAPSHOT`.

Use Maven to repackage your microservice:
[role=command]
```
mvn clean package
```

Next, build the new version of the container image as `2.0-SNAPSHOT`:
[role=command]
```
docker build -t system:2.0-SNAPSHOT .
```

Deploy the new image to the green deployment.

[role=command]
```
kubectl set image deployment/system-deployment-green system-container=system:2.0-SNAPSHOT
```

You will work with two environments.
One of the environments is a test site that is located at `test.example.com`.
The other environment is your production environment that is located at `example.com`.
To begin with, the production environment is tied to the blue deployment and the test environment is tied to the green deployment.

Test the updated microservice by making requests to the test site.
The `x-app-version` header now has a value of `2.0-SNAPSHOT` on the test site and is still `1.0-SNAPSHOT` on the live site.

Make a request to the service by running the following `curl` command.

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]

[.tab_content.windows_section.mac_section]
--
[role=command]
```
curl -H "Host:test.example.com" -I http://localhost/system/properties
```
If the `curl` command is unavailable, then use https://www.getpostman.com/[Postman^].
--

[.tab_content.linux_section]
--
//Make a request to the service by using `curl`.
[role=command]
```
curl -H "Host:test.example.com" -I http://`minikube ip`:$INGRESS_PORT/system/properties
```
--

You'll see the new version in the `x-app-version` response header.

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
x-app-version: 2.0-SNAPSHOT
----

[role="code_command hotspot file=1", subs="quotes"]

----

traffic.yaml
[source, yaml, linenums, role='code_column', file=1]
----
include::finish/traffic.yaml[tags=**;]
----

[role="edit_command_text"]
After you see that the microservice is working on the test site, modify the [hotspot=17 hotspot=23 hotspot=41 hotspot=47 file=1]`weights` in the `traffic.yaml` file to shift 100 percent of the `example.com` traffic to the green deployment, and 100 percent of the `test.example.com` traffic to the blue deployment.


Deploy the updated `traffic.yaml` file.

[role=command]
```
kubectl apply -f traffic.yaml
```

Ensure that the live traffic is now being routed to version 2 of the microservice.


Make a request to the service by running the following `curl` command.

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]

[.tab_content.windows_section]
--
[role=command]
```
curl -H "Host:example.com" -I http://localhost/system/properties

--

[.tab_content.linux_section]
--
[role=command]
```

```
--


You'll see the new version in the `x-app-version` response header.

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
x-app-version: 2.0-SNAPSHOT
----

== Testing microservices that are running on {kube}

Next, you will create a test to verify that the correct version of your microservice is running.

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `SystemEndpointIT` class.#
`src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/system/SystemEndpointIT.java`
----
SystemEndpointIT.java
[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/system/SystemEndpointIT.java[]
----

The [hotspot=testAppVersion]`testAppVersion()` test case verifies that the correct version number is returned in the response headers.

Run the following commands to compile and start the tests:

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]

[.tab_content.windows_section.mac_section]
--
[role=command]
```
mvn test-compile
mvn failsafe:integration-test
```
--

[.tab_content.linux_section]
--
[role=command]
```
mvn test-compile
mvn failsafe:integration-test -Dcluster.ip=`minikube ip` -Dport=$INGRESS_PORT
```
The `cluster.ip` and `port` parameters refer to the IP address and port for the {istio} gateway.
--

If the tests pass, then you should see output similar to the following example:

[source, role="no_copy"]
----

----

== Tearing down your environment

You might want to teardown all the deployed resources as a cleanup step.

Delete your resources from the cluster:

[role=command]
```
kubectl delete -f system.yaml
kubectl delete -f traffic.yaml
```

Delete the `istio-injection` label from the default namespace. The hyphen immediately
after the label name indicates that the label should be deleted.

[role=command]
```
kubectl label namespace default istio-injection-
```

Delete all {istio} resources from the cluster:

[role=command]
```
istioctl x uninstall --purge
```
